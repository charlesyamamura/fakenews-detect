## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze news articles and classify them as either "Fake News" or "Factual News" using several NLP techniques. The repository includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Tokenization and part-of-speech tagging
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Sentiment analysis using VADER
- Topic modeling with LDA and LSI
- Machine learning classification models (Logistic Regression and SVM)
- Evaluation and visualization of results
